# Bacteria_Growth
Image processing of Bacteria pictures taken at 5-minute intervals.

The goal of this assignment is to calculate the doubling time of the E. Coli bacteria. The doubling time is the time it takes for a bacteria culture to double its size.

We will use a series of images E. coli cells growing on a hard agar substrate at 100x magnification taken at 5-minute intervals.
